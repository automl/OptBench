## Running an optimizer from carps
The command for running an optimizer, e.g., random search from carps on OptBench looks as follows:
```bash
python -m carps.run 'hydra.searchpath=[pkg://optbench/configs]' +optimizer/randomsearch=config +task/OptBench=Ackley_2 seed=1
```
The breakdown of the command:
- `'hydra.searchpath=[pkg://optbench/configs]'`: Let hydra know where to find the configs of the OptBench package. For this, `optbench` needs to be installed. It is in general: pkg://PACKAGE_NAME/PATH_INSIDE_PACKAGE_TO_CONFIGS_FOLDER .
- `+optimizer/randomsearch=config`: select an optimizer from `carps`. Follows the config folder structure in `carps`. Beware, for other optimizers you need to install dependencies (check the [repo](https://github.com/automl/CARP-S)).
- `+task/OptBench=Ackley_2`: Select a problem. Follows the configs folder structure in this package, starting from `optbench/configs`.
- `seed=1`: Set the seed to 1. ðŸ™‚

Of course, you can also specify the run dir etc.
